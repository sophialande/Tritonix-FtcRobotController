# **WELCOME!**

This is the directory for the autonomous opMode and autonomous section of our play. It includes all
the classes that are exclusively needed during auto, including the auto opMode itself. If you have
any questions regarding this folder, feel free to ask Sophia or Noah.

## AutoOpMode

This is the big one. This class is the one that contains our autonomous opMode, that means that all
of the code in there is the code that will run at the start of our match during the auto period.
Currently it is being used as a test ground for various Robot functions, but soon enough it will be
the beating heart of our robots performance. Don't be shy to ask Sophia or Noah if you are confused
about anything regarding the AutoOpMode class, there is also the comment about the OpMode to help.

## Driver

The Driver class has all of the commands that can allow our robot to move. You can use
Driver.drive() to make the robot move in a direction of your choice, and Driver.rotate() to spin it
around in happy circles. Once again if there is anything you are curious about look for the comment
above the class or as Noah.
