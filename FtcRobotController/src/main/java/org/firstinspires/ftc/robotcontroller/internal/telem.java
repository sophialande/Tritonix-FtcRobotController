/* USAGE GUIDE:
 * The purpose of this class is to introduce the capability to include data in the telemetry output
 * for more than just one update. This is useful when you would like to, for example, include a
 * status (such as "sample in hand") while the robot is moving (when it will likely be constantly
 * updating telemetry).
 *
 * To add something to the permanent telemetry list, call telem.add(a, b), imagine it is exactly
 * like telemetry.addData() but with a different name. So a is the value and it will be printed
 * followed by ": " and then b. Unlike in telemetry.addData() both a and b must be strings. If
 * something is already on the list with that name (a), it will be replaced.
 *
 * To remove something from the permanent telemetry list, call telem.remove(a), where a is the name
 * of the thing you would like to remove. a must be a string.
 *
 * WHENEVER you wish to update the telemetry, instead of using telemetry.update(), use
 * telem.update(). Otherwise it will be updated without the permanent list. IMPORTANT: IF YOU WISH
 * TO INCLUDE DATA THAT WILL CHANGE EVERY UPDATE, SIMPLY USE telemetry.addData(). OTHERWISE YOU
 * WILL BE MAKING THE ROBOT RUN MUCH MORE SLOWELY, REDUCING OUR POSITION ACCURACY AND GIVING THE
 * OPPONENT A LEG UP.
